                    <p>I come from a big family in Ann Arbor, Michigan. My family is a little different from most due to
                        the fact that my mother's sister married my father's brother. That's right, two brothers married
                        two sister. I consider myself the youngest of five technically. In my immediate family, I have an
                        older sister who is five years older than me, and my brother who is eight years my senior. My aunt
                        and uncle have a boy, who is also five years older, and a girl who is 3 months older. The five of
                        us grew up together and are extremely close.</p>

                    <p>I went to the University of Michigan to study environmental science and graduated in 2015. Afterwards,
                        I worked as a contract field biologist for the city of Ann Arbor looking at how the overpopulation
                        of deer affect the native plant communities.
                    </p>

                    <p>In July of 2018 I enrolled at a full stack coding bootcamp through Northwestern. I wanted to make
                        a career shift after working in several different industries over the past several years. It was
                        time to make a change and begin learning a new set of skills.</p>
